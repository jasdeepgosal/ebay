    <p>
      I have been a collector for many years. As space is limited I clear out some items often. Now is the time again.

    <h3>
      Condition
    </h3>
    <p>
      I sell mostly vintage. If you are looking for an item straight from the shop do not buy used clothing. Most are in good condition and I take everything in pictures so what you see if what you get. If you aren't sure about an item looking at the pictures I provided, do not buy the item. It is too difficult dealing with complains later on. I have 1100 feedbacks and have kept my result at 100% positive i am honest and want to it keep it that way. There are limitations on buying online such as trying things on and all, know your sizes and read my measurements (not professional but i try my best) Some clothes are used on photoshoots so may need a wash and most are folded in suitcases so need to be ironed.
